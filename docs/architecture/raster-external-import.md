# Raster External Import

## Status

C6 design specification.

This document defines the first public retained-storage import boundary built
above the package-internal raster construction layer.

No raw ResourceEntry representation is part of the public API.

## 1. Goals

The import layer must allow externally allocated raster storage to become a
RasterLease while preserving the existing invariants:

- ownership transfers exactly once;
- every adopted resource is released exactly once;
- release callback state remains valid until release;
- caller metadata is not retained accidentally;
- byte-oriented external layouts are validated before becoming
  element-oriented PlaneDescriptors;
- RasterView remains a cheap non-owning borrow;
- global LogicalImage placement remains outside RasterView;
- raw callback/context construction remains behind an audited boundary.

The first C6 adapter deliberately supports one retained physical resource.

This is sufficient for:

- single-band buffers;
- pixel-interleaved RGB/RGBA;
- several logical planes sharing one allocation;
- decoder outputs backed by one allocation;
- external libraries returning one contiguous or strided buffer.

Multi-resource planar import is a later extension.

The underlying RasterBacking already supports that topology.

## 2. Layering

```text
external allocation
        |
        | explicit adoption
        v
OwnedByteResource
        |
        | move-only retained ownership
        v
PlaneByteLayout[]
        |
        | checked conversion for T
        v
PlaneDescriptor[]
        |
        | audited transition
        v
constructRetainedRaster() @system
        |
        v
RasterLease!T
        |
        | borrow
        v
RasterView!T
```

## 3. OwnedByteResource

The public API should expose an ownership token conceptually equivalent to:

```d
struct OwnedByteResource
{
    @disable this(this);

    // implementation-private ownership state
}
```

The public representation must not expose:

- ResourceEntry;
- ReleaseFn;
- releaseContext;
- arbitrary release callback registration.

The token owns exactly one physical byte range.

Destroying an armed token releases that physical resource exactly once.

Moving/adopting the token transfers that obligation.

An empty/disarmed token owns nothing.

## 4. Initial public adoption mechanism

The first public ownership factory should support malloc-compatible storage.

Conceptually:

```d
OwnedByteResource adoptMallocResource(
    void* base,
    size_t byteLength
)
@system;
```

The function is `@system` because the caller is asserting that:

- base identifies an allocation compatible with free();
- byteLength correctly describes that allocation;
- ownership is being transferred;
- the caller will not free the allocation afterward.

Once successfully represented by OwnedByteResource, ordinary manipulation of
the token does not require callers to handle raw release callbacks.

A null base with non-zero byteLength is invalid.

The exact result/error spelling is not frozen by this document.

## 5. Source-specific adoption

Future source adapters may require release mechanisms other than free():

```text
mmap        -> munmap
decoder     -> decoder-specific release
GDAL/C API  -> library-specific destroy/free
GPU staging -> backend-specific release
```

These adapters may create OwnedByteResource through a package-internal
`@system` factory.

That factory may accept ResourceEntry-style release state internally.

It must not become part of the general public API.

Each source adapter is responsible for proving the lifetime of any opaque
release context it installs.

## 6. External plane layout

External APIs commonly describe strides in bytes.

The public import boundary should therefore use byte-oriented layout metadata,
not PlaneDescriptor directly.

Conceptually:

```d
struct PlaneByteLayout
{
    size_t byteOffset;

    ptrdiff_t rowStrideBytes;

    ptrdiff_t sampleStrideBytes;
}
```

`byteOffset` is relative to the start of the owned physical resource.

It identifies descriptor coordinate `(0, 0)` for that logical plane.

Signed byte strides permit validated negative traversal.

## 7. Why PlaneDescriptor is not the import format

PlaneDescriptor is an internal/core execution-facing representation:

```text
base pointer
row stride in T elements
sample stride in T elements
```

An external API generally starts with:

```text
allocation base
byte offset
row stride in bytes
sample stride in bytes
```

Accepting PlaneDescriptor directly would force callers to perform trusted
pointer arithmetic and byte-to-element conversions themselves.

That is precisely the work the import adapter should centralize.

## 8. Checked conversion

For sample type T, each PlaneByteLayout must be converted before raw retained
construction.

The adapter must prove at least:

1. T satisfies isRasterSampleType!T.

2. byteOffset lies within the physical resource.

3. allocation base plus byteOffset is representable.

4. resulting plane base satisfies T alignment.

5. rowStrideBytes is exactly divisible by T.sizeof.

6. sampleStrideBytes is exactly divisible by T.sizeof.

7. converted row stride fits ptrdiff_t.

8. converted sample stride fits ptrdiff_t.

9. resident Region2D endpoint arithmetic is representable.

10. the complete affine footprint lies within the owned physical resource.

The existing backing validator remains the final physical-footprint check.

The adapter performs representation conversion checks before entering the raw
construction layer.

## 9. Signed byte-stride conversion

Signed strides require care.

The conversion must not use unchecked operations whose behavior fails for
ptrdiff_t.min.

Conceptually:

```text
byte stride
    |
    | exact divisibility by sizeof(T)
    v
signed element stride
    |
    | representable in ptrdiff_t
    v
PlaneDescriptor stride
```

The implementation should use explicit checked helpers rather than relying on
implicit casts.

## 10. Ownership semantics of raster adoption

The raster-import operation is an adopting operation.

Conceptually:

```d
RasterImportResult adoptRaster(
    ref OwnedByteResource resource,
    const PlaneByteLayout[] planes,
    Region2D residentRegion,
    out RasterLease!T lease
);
```

The exact API spelling is intentionally not frozen yet.

The ownership contract is more important than the function name.

When adoption begins:

```text
caller
   |
   | transfers OwnedByteResource
   v
import adapter
```

From that point onward exactly one owner must remain responsible for release.

If layout conversion fails after ownership transfer, the adapter releases the
resource.

If raw retained construction fails, its transactional ownership machinery
releases the resource.

If construction succeeds, RasterBacking becomes the owner.

The caller must not retain a second release obligation.

## 11. Why the token is preferable to a naked pointer API

A direct function such as:

```d
adoptRaster(void* base, size_t bytes, ...)
```

would combine too many responsibilities in one call.

A separate ownership token provides:

- explicit ownership state;
- RAII cleanup before raster construction;
- a place to encode disarmed/moved state;
- no public release callback/context;
- a reusable source-adapter boundary;
- easier future support for multiple physical resources.

## 12. First C6 topology

C6 supports:

```text
one OwnedByteResource
        |
        +--> Plane 0
        +--> Plane 1
        `--> Plane N
```

Example pixel-interleaved RGB ubyte:

```text
resource:
    byteLength = width * height * 3

Plane 0:
    byteOffset        = 0
    rowStrideBytes    = width * 3
    sampleStrideBytes = 3

Plane 1:
    byteOffset        = 1
    rowStrideBytes    = width * 3
    sampleStrideBytes = 3

Plane 2:
    byteOffset        = 2
    rowStrideBytes    = width * 3
    sampleStrideBytes = 3
```

This converts naturally into the already-tested shared-resource
PlaneDescriptor topology.

## 13. Planar storage

A single allocation containing consecutive planar bands is also supported by
the first C6 topology.

Example:

```text
resource
+-------------+
| red plane   |
+-------------+
| green plane |
+-------------+
| blue plane  |
+-------------+
```

Each PlaneByteLayout uses a different byteOffset into the same
OwnedByteResource.

Independent per-plane allocations require the later multi-resource extension.

## 14. Borrowed storage is separate

C6 retained import must not attempt to solve pure borrowed storage.

Borrowed storage has different lifetime semantics.

It should eventually use a scoped API conceptually similar to:

```d
withBorrowedRaster(..., scope delegate(RasterView!T) operation)
```

A borrowed pointer must never be disguised as OwnedByteResource by installing
a no-op release callback.

## 15. Mutability is separate

The first external import remains read-only at the RasterView capability
level.

Physical memory may happen to be writable, but read-only RasterLease /
RasterView construction does not grant mutation capability.

Mutable retained import belongs to the later MutableRasterView phase.

## 16. Global coordinates are separate

PlaneByteLayout and resident Region2D describe resident storage only.

Example:

```text
LogicalImage request:
    Region2D(100000, 200000, 512, 512)

imported resident raster:
    Region2D(0, 0, 512, 512)
```

The global placement belongs to request/cache/task metadata above RasterView.

## 17. Safety boundary

The expected safety layering is:

```text
raw pointer ownership claim
        |
        | @system adoption factory
        v
OwnedByteResource
        |
        | safe ownership token
        v
checked layout adapter
        |
        | small audited @trusted implementation
        v
raw retained construction @system
        |
        v
RasterLease
```

The trusted adapter may call the raw @system constructor only after it has
established the invariants promised by its public API.

## 18. Error model

Import-specific errors should remain distinct from backing-validation errors.

Likely categories include:

```text
empty / invalid ownership token
invalid byte offset
misaligned plane base
row stride not divisible by sample size
sample stride not divisible by sample size
stride conversion overflow
construction failure
```

BackingValidationResult should remain available when the final retained
validator rejects the physical footprint.

The exact enum names are not frozen yet.

## 19. Non-goals of C6

C6 does not yet define:

- multiple independently owned physical resources;
- borrowed raster construction;
- mutable raster construction;
- mmap-specific public APIs;
- GDAL-specific public APIs;
- decoder-specific public APIs;
- GPU resources;
- cache ownership;
- global LogicalImage placement;
- runtime sample-type dispatch.

## 20. Required mechanical tests

Before C6 is considered complete, tests should prove:

1. malloc ownership transfers exactly once.

2. failed import releases the allocation exactly once.

3. successful import retains storage until the final RasterLease disappears.

4. caller layout metadata may disappear immediately after import.

5. interleaved shared-resource RGB maps to correct logical bands.

6. single-allocation planar bands map correctly.

7. non-zero byteOffset is handled correctly.

8. invalid byteOffset is rejected.

9. misaligned T base is rejected.

10. non-divisible byte strides are rejected.

11. signed negative byte strides convert correctly.

12. stride conversion overflow is rejected.

13. final affine footprint outside the resource is rejected.

14. @safe code cannot forge raw ResourceEntry ownership.

15. the public token does not expose release callback/context state.

16. all existing lifetime compile probes remain green.

## C6.1 implementation: ownership token

C6.1 implements the first layer of this design:

```text
raw malloc allocation
        |
        | @system explicit adoption
        v
OwnedByteResource
```

Implemented invariants:

- OwnedByteResource is move-only.
- An armed token carries exactly one release obligation.
- Destruction releases that obligation exactly once.
- Moving transfers the obligation.
- Relinquishing to package-internal raw construction disarms the token.
- The public malloc-compatible adoption boundary is @system.
- ResourceEntry and ReleaseFn remain outside the public raster API.
- Raw callback/context adoption remains package-internal and @system.

C6.1 deliberately does not yet implement:

- PlaneByteLayout;
- byte-stride conversion;
- RasterLease import;
- multiple physical resources;
- borrowed storage.

Those belong to later C6 implementation steps.

## C6.1 adoption-target semantics

OwnedByteResource adoption uses a `ref` target, never an `out` target.

This is an ownership requirement rather than a stylistic API choice.

D initializes an `out` argument to `T.init` when the function is entered.
That operation is unsuitable for an RAII ownership token because an existing
release obligation must never be erased by resetting the token state.

The adoption rule is therefore:

```text
empty target + valid candidate
    -> adopt candidate

armed target
    -> reject
    -> existing target unchanged
    -> candidate remains caller-owned

invalid candidate
    -> reject
    -> target unchanged
```

Adoption never means "replace".

A caller that intentionally wants to replace an owned resource must first end
or explicitly transfer the old ownership obligation and only then perform a
new adoption.

This keeps every ownership transition explicit and exact-once.

## C6.2 implementation: byte-oriented plane layout

C6.2 implements the ownership-independent external layout layer:

```text
PlaneByteLayout
        |
        | sample type T known
        | exact checked byte conversion
        v
PlaneDescriptor
```

PlaneByteLayout is public metadata and owns no storage.

The conversion helper remains package-internal and `@system` because it accepts
a raw external resource base pointer.

C6.2 does not consume or mutate OwnedByteResource.

### Byte stride representation

`rowStrideBytes` and `sampleStrideBytes` are already represented as
`ptrdiff_t`.

For a valid raster sample type T, conversion requires:

```text
byteStride % T.sizeof == 0
```

and then:

```text
elementStride = byteStride / T.sizeof
```

Because the source value already fits `ptrdiff_t` and `T.sizeof` is positive,
an exact division cannot increase the magnitude of the value.

There is therefore no separate runtime "element stride overflow" after exact
division.

The implementation deliberately performs no absolute-value conversion and no
negation of the byte stride. This is important for `ptrdiff_t.min`.

### Conversion validation

C6.2 proves:

- resource base is non-null;
- resource byte range arithmetic is representable;
- byteOffset identifies a byte inside the resource;
- base + byteOffset is representable;
- plane base satisfies T alignment;
- rowStrideBytes is exactly divisible by T.sizeof;
- sampleStrideBytes is exactly divisible by T.sizeof.

C6.2 deliberately does not prove the complete two-dimensional affine
footprint.

That remains the responsibility of the existing retained-backing validator
once C6.3 combines:

```text
physical resource
PlaneDescriptor[]
resident Region2D
```

### Ownership separation

The C6.2 conversion has no ownership transition.

In particular:

```text
OwnedByteResource
    is not consumed

release obligations
    do not change

PlaneByteLayout
    is caller-owned metadata

PlaneDescriptor
    is derived metadata only
```

C6.3 will be the first layer that transactionally joins ownership and converted
layout metadata.

## C6.3 implementation: transactional single-resource join

C6.3 introduces the first transactional join of ownership and layout metadata.

The implementation remains package-internal while the final public result and
error surface is reviewed.

The phases are:

```text
OwnedByteResource armed
        |
        | temporary descriptor allocation
        | PlaneByteLayout conversion
        |
        | PRE-COMMIT
        | failures preserve OwnedByteResource
        v
all PlaneDescriptors valid
        |
        | relinquishResource()
        |
        | COMMIT POINT
        v
constructRetainedRaster()
        |
        +--> success
        |      RasterLease owns physical resource
        |
        `--> failure
               construction releases physical resource
               no RasterLease is published
```

### Pre-commit failures

These leave the ownership token unchanged:

- empty plane-layout list;
- temporary descriptor metadata size overflow;
- temporary descriptor allocation failure;
- any PlaneByteLayout conversion failure;
- non-empty RasterLease output target.

### Post-commit failures

After `relinquishResource()` the caller token is disarmed.

The raw ResourceEntry is immediately passed into the already-tested
transactional retained-construction layer.

If backing validation or retained metadata construction fails, that layer
releases the physical resource exactly once.

### Output target

The package-internal join takes RasterLease by `ref`, not `out`.

As with OwnedByteResource adoption, a live ownership-bearing object must never
be implicitly reset merely because it is used as a function output target.

The current implementation requires the RasterLease target to be empty.

### Public API status

C6.3 does not yet freeze the public import function name or public error model.

The next review should decide whether the public API exposes:

- a `try...` function with an explicit result object;
- a returned result carrying the RasterLease;
- or another ownership-preserving spelling.

The transactional implementation underneath that surface is now independent
of that choice.

## C6.3a full validation before ownership commit

The transactional join performs complete backing reachability validation before
relinquishing OwnedByteResource.

This strengthens the ownership contract established by C6.3.

The sequence is now:

```text
OwnedByteResource armed
        |
        + PlaneByteLayout[]
        + resident Region2D
        |
        v
byte-layout conversion
        |
        v
PlaneDescriptor[]
        |
        v
validateRasterBackingLayout()
        |
    +---+---+
    |       |
 invalid   valid
    |       |
    |       v
    |   COMMIT POINT
    |       |
    |       v
    |   relinquishResource()
    |       |
    |       v
    |   retained construction
    |
    v
OwnedByteResource remains armed
```

Consequently all caller-controlled representation and geometry failures are
pre-commit failures:

- invalid byte offset;
- alignment failure;
- non-divisible byte stride;
- coordinate representation failure;
- stride/offset arithmetic failure;
- affine footprint outside the retained byte range;
- invalid resident Region2D geometry.

On every such failure the caller still owns the original
OwnedByteResource.

Only after complete physical validation succeeds does the join transfer the
release obligation to retained construction.

The retained construction layer continues to validate independently. This is
intentional defense in depth: the pre-commit validation provides transactional
API semantics, while retained construction continues to protect its own raw
boundary.

## C6.3b deterministic scratch allocation and trusted boundary

The single-resource join now separates implementation mechanics from the
trusted certification point.

The internal structure is:

```text
package importSingleOwnedResource()
             |
             | small audited @trusted wrapper
             v
private importSingleOwnedResourceWithDescriptorOps()
             |
             | @system implementation
             |
             +-- raw OwnedByteResource access
             +-- temporary descriptor allocation
             +-- byte-layout conversion
             +-- backing validation
             +-- ownership relinquishment
             `-- raw retained construction
```

The production wrapper supplies one matching scratch allocation pair:

```text
malloc
  |
  +--> temporary PlaneDescriptor[]
  |
free
```

The injectable descriptor allocation operations exist only to make failure
paths deterministic in unit tests. They are not part of the public API.

### Descriptor allocation failure

Failure to allocate the temporary PlaneDescriptor table is a PRE-COMMIT
failure.

Therefore:

```text
descriptor allocation fails
        |
        v
OwnedByteResource remains armed
RasterLease remains empty
physical resource is not released
```

### Scratch cleanup after later pre-commit failure

If scratch allocation succeeds but byte-layout conversion or backing
validation later fails, the temporary descriptor table is released exactly
once while the physical resource remains owned by OwnedByteResource.

### Trusted certification

The package-level production wrapper is the only `@trusted` function in the
single-resource join module.

The larger implementation is explicitly `@system`.

This makes the trust decision easy to locate and audit. The wrapper certifies
that the system implementation is safe only under the documented production
configuration and invariants.

The wrapper does not expose:

- ResourceEntry;
- raw resource pointers;
- allocator hooks;
- release callbacks;
- release contexts.

## C6.4 public owned-raster import API contract

The internal retained-import machinery is now sufficiently isolated and tested
to define its public surface.

C6.4 first freezes the public contract before exporting implementation
symbols.

### Public goal

After a caller has safely encapsulated an external allocation in
OwnedByteResource, constructing a read-only retained raster should require no
further raw-pointer operations.

The intended safety transition is:

```text
raw external allocation
        |
        | explicit @system ownership claim
        v
OwnedByteResource
        |
        | public @safe raster import
        v
RasterLease!T
        |
        | lifetime-checked borrow
        v
RasterView!T
```

The raw pointer ownership claim remains inherently `@system`.

The raster import itself can be `@safe` because all raw storage operations are
contained behind the audited package-internal import boundary.

## Public function

The intended public spelling is:

```d
OwnedRasterImportResult tryImportOwnedRaster(T)(
    ref OwnedByteResource resource,
    scope const(PlaneByteLayout)[] planes,
    Region2D residentRegion,
    ref RasterLease!T lease
)
@safe;
```

The exact implementation is added only after this contract is accepted by the
existing DMD/LDC validation matrix.

### Why `tryImportOwnedRaster`

The name communicates three properties:

1. the source is already an explicit ownership token;
2. raster construction may fail;
3. ownership effects on failure are defined transactionally.

The function does not accept a naked pointer.

## Output lease

`lease` must be empty on entry.

It is passed by `ref`, never by `out`.

A non-empty lease is rejected before any ownership transition.

On success:

```text
resource.ownsResource == false
lease.hasBacking       == true
```

The resulting RasterLease owns the retained backing.

## Public error abstraction

Internal implementation errors must not become part of the stable public API.

In particular the public package does not export:

- PlaneByteLayoutConversionError;
- PlaneByteLayoutConversionResult;
- BackingValidationError;
- BackingValidationResult;
- RasterConstructionError;
- SingleResourceRasterImportError;
- SingleResourceRasterImportResult.

Instead the public API exposes a stable import-oriented error vocabulary.

Conceptually:

```d
enum OwnedRasterImportError : ubyte
{
    none,

    emptyResource,

    outputLeaseNotEmpty,

    noPlanes,

    temporaryMetadataAllocationFailed,

    invalidPlaneLayout,

    invalidBackingLayout,

    backingAllocationFailed,

    internalConstructionFailure
}
```

The distinction is semantic rather than a one-to-one export of internal enums.

## Error mapping

The public mapping is:

```text
internal                                      public
----------------------------------------------------------------------
emptyResource                              -> emptyResource

outputLeaseNotEmpty                        -> outputLeaseNotEmpty

noPlanes                                   -> noPlanes

descriptorMetadataAllocationFailed         -> temporaryMetadataAllocationFailed

planeLayoutConversionFailed                -> invalidPlaneLayout

backingValidationFailed                    -> invalidBackingLayout

retained construction:
  resourceMetadataAllocationFailed
  descriptorMetadataAllocationFailed       -> backingAllocationFailed

retained construction:
  unexpected validation failure
  unexpected metadata-size overflow
  other impossible/invariant failures      -> internalConstructionFailure
```

The public surface therefore exposes actionable categories without leaking
construction-layer implementation details.

## Plane index

For `invalidPlaneLayout`, the public result should expose the zero-based logical
plane index that failed conversion.

Conceptually:

```d
size_t planeIndex;
```

For errors that do not identify one plane:

```text
planeIndex == size_t.max
```

The detailed package-internal byte-layout error remains internal for now.

This avoids freezing low-level conversion diagnostics prematurely.

## Resource disposition

A caller must be able to determine whether the physical ownership obligation
still exists after a failed import.

The public result therefore exposes a derived resource disposition.

Conceptually:

```d
enum OwnedRasterResourceDisposition : ubyte
{
    unchanged,

    transferredToLease,

    releasedAfterCommit
}
```

The mapping is:

```text
success
    -> transferredToLease

all PRE-COMMIT failures
    -> unchanged

recoverable retained-construction failure after ownership commit
    -> releasedAfterCommit
```

This is an important part of the API contract.

A caller must not infer ownership merely from whether the operation returned an
error.

## Result object

Conceptually:

```d
struct OwnedRasterImportResult
{
private:
    OwnedRasterImportError error_;

    size_t planeIndex_ = size_t.max;

    OwnedRasterResourceDisposition resourceDisposition_;

public:
    @property OwnedRasterImportError error() const;

    @property size_t planeIndex() const;

    @property bool ok() const;

    @property
    OwnedRasterResourceDisposition resourceDisposition() const;
}
```

The resource disposition is stored explicitly in the result produced by the
import implementation.

It must not be derived solely from the public error category.

The reason is that one public error category can intentionally abstract
multiple internal failures that occur on different sides of the ownership
commit point.

For example:

```text
descriptor scratch metadata size overflow
    -> internalConstructionFailure
    -> PRE-COMMIT
    -> unchanged

unexpected retained-construction invariant failure
    -> internalConstructionFailure
    -> POST-COMMIT
    -> releasedAfterCommit
```

Therefore the public mapper must construct the error category and resource
disposition together from the internal result and its known ownership phase.

The result fields remain private so callers cannot create contradictory
combinations such as:

```text
error == none
resourceDisposition == unchanged
```

## Pre-commit errors

All caller-controlled representation and geometry failures occur before
ownership transfer.

Therefore these preserve the original OwnedByteResource:

```text
emptyResource
outputLeaseNotEmpty
noPlanes
temporaryMetadataAllocationFailed
invalidPlaneLayout
invalidBackingLayout
```

For all of them:

```text
resourceDisposition == unchanged
```

and, when the input resource was initially armed:

```text
resource.ownsResource == true
```

## Post-commit errors

Once complete input validation has succeeded, the implementation commits the
physical ownership obligation to retained construction.

A later retained backing metadata allocation failure may then release the
resource without publishing a RasterLease.

The public API reports this explicitly as:

```text
backingAllocationFailed
resourceDisposition == releasedAfterCommit
```

An unexpected invariant failure after commit is reported as:

```text
internalConstructionFailure
resourceDisposition == releasedAfterCommit
```

The caller must not attempt to release the original physical allocation after
either result.

## Success

Success means:

```text
error == none
resourceDisposition == transferredToLease
resource.ownsResource == false
lease.hasBacking == true
```

The physical allocation remains alive until the last RasterLease retaining the
RasterBacking is destroyed.

## Public safety

The public function should be declared `@safe`.

This is deliberate.

The unsafe claim occurred earlier when the external allocation was adopted:

```d
tryAdoptMallocResource(...)
@system
```

After a valid OwnedByteResource exists, the public import operation manipulates
only:

- ownership tokens;
- value metadata;
- checked region geometry;
- a RasterLease output target.

All raw pointer access remains behind the already-audited package-level
`@trusted` join.

A compile-time probe must prove that ordinary `@safe` code can call
tryImportOwnedRaster once it has an OwnedByteResource supplied by its caller.

## Public ownership contract

The resulting API can be summarized as:

```text
PRE-COMMIT failure
    resource preserved

SUCCESS
    resource moved into RasterLease

POST-COMMIT failure
    resource released exactly once
```

This contract is independent of the current internal implementation structure
and should remain stable if the retained backing implementation is later
refactored.

## Single-resource scope

The first public function supports exactly one physical OwnedByteResource.

Multiple PlaneByteLayout entries may reference different byte offsets within
that resource.

This supports:

- single-band buffers;
- interleaved RGB/RGBA;
- single-allocation planar layouts;
- decoder outputs backed by one allocation.

Multiple independently owned physical allocations remain a later extension.

The future multi-resource API should preserve the same transactional concepts
but must define disposition for each ownership token or for an aggregate
ownership object.

## Borrowed storage

Pure borrowed raster construction remains a separate API family.

It must not reuse OwnedByteResource and must not install a no-op release
callback.

The retained-import API defined here does not imply ownership semantics for
borrowed storage.

## Mutability

The public retained import creates the existing read-only RasterLease /
RasterView capability.

It does not grant MutableRasterView access even if the underlying physical
allocation happens to be writable.

Mutable import remains a separate later capability boundary.

## Required public API tests

Before the C6 public API is considered complete, implementation must prove:

1. `tryImportOwnedRaster` is callable from `@safe` code.

2. raw ResourceEntry and release callback/context state remain inaccessible
   through the public raster package.

3. success reports:
   - error == none;
   - transferredToLease;
   - source token disarmed;
   - output lease armed.

4. invalidPlaneLayout reports:
   - correct plane index;
   - unchanged;
   - source token still armed;
   - output lease empty.

5. invalidBackingLayout reports unchanged ownership.

6. temporaryMetadataAllocationFailed reports unchanged ownership.

7. outputLeaseNotEmpty leaves both existing lease and candidate resource
   unchanged.

8. backingAllocationFailed reports releasedAfterCommit.

9. no public error type exposes RasterConstructionError or
   BackingValidationResult.

10. all previous construction, ownership and lifetime compile probes remain
    green under both DMD and LDC.

## C6.4a explicit disposition correction

The C6.4 review identified one ambiguity before implementation.

`OwnedRasterImportError` is intentionally a higher-level abstraction over
several internal failure categories. Consequently an error value alone does
not always identify whether ownership crossed the commit point.

The public result therefore stores resource disposition explicitly.

The internal-to-public mapping must set both values atomically.

The essential mapping is:

```text
internal failure                              public error
                                              disposition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

emptyResource                                emptyResource
                                              unchanged

outputLeaseNotEmpty                          outputLeaseNotEmpty
                                              unchanged

noPlanes                                     noPlanes
                                              unchanged

descriptorMetadataSizeOverflow               internalConstructionFailure
                                              unchanged

descriptorMetadataAllocationFailed           temporaryMetadataAllocationFailed
                                              unchanged

planeLayoutConversionFailed                  invalidPlaneLayout
                                              unchanged

backingValidationFailed                      invalidBackingLayout
                                              unchanged

retained construction:
  resourceMetadataAllocationFailed           backingAllocationFailed
  descriptorMetadataAllocationFailed          releasedAfterCommit

retained construction:
  validationFailed
  resourceMetadataSizeOverflow
  descriptorMetadataSizeOverflow
  other unexpected invariant failure         internalConstructionFailure
                                              releasedAfterCommit

success                                      none
                                              transferredToLease
```

This preserves the stable public error vocabulary while making the ownership
state unambiguous.

The public `OwnedRasterImportResult` should expose its state through read-only
properties. Construction of arbitrary error/disposition combinations should
remain internal to the raster package.

## C6.5 implementation: public owned-raster import

C6.5 implements the public single-resource retained-import surface defined by
C6.4 and corrected by C6.4a.

The exported API is:

```d
enum OwnedRasterImportError;

enum OwnedRasterResourceDisposition;

struct OwnedRasterImportResult;

OwnedRasterImportResult tryImportOwnedRaster(T)(
    ref OwnedByteResource resource,
    scope const(PlaneByteLayout)[] planes,
    Region2D residentRegion,
    ref RasterLease!T lease
)
@safe;
```

### Safety layering

The public call path is:

```text
public @safe tryImportOwnedRaster()
        |
        | public/internal result mapping only
        v
package @trusted importSingleOwnedResource()
        |
        v
private @system transactional implementation
```

No new public trusted or system boundary is introduced.

### Result construction

OwnedRasterImportResult fields are private.

Its `.init` state deliberately represents a non-successful internal failure
with unchanged resource disposition.

Only the raster import module constructs successful or ownership-changing
results.

Consequently callers cannot fabricate contradictory combinations such as:

```text
error == none
resourceDisposition == unchanged
```

### Explicit disposition

The public mapper constructs error and resource disposition together.

In particular the same public error category may carry different dispositions:

```text
internalConstructionFailure + unchanged

internalConstructionFailure + releasedAfterCommit
```

depending on which side of the ownership commit point the internal failure
occurred.

### Public compile guarantees

C6.5 adds compiler probes establishing that:

- `@safe` code can call tryImportOwnedRaster when given an
  OwnedByteResource;
- package-internal SingleResourceRasterImport types are not exported through
  raster;
- public callers cannot mutate the private result state.

These probes run under both DMD and LDC in CI.

## C6.6 public import closure audit

C6.6 adds closure coverage for the first public retained-import API.

The audit exercises the public import semantics for:

- pixel-interleaved RGB in one physical allocation;
- planar RGB in one physical allocation;
- empty resident extents with a valid retained plane base;
- public rejection of direct construction of arbitrary
  OwnedRasterImportResult states.

The RGB cases are important because they prove that the public API preserves
the core separation between logical planes and physical storage topology.

Interleaved RGB uses three logical PlaneByteLayout values with byte offsets
0, 1, and 2 and a sample stride of three bytes.

Single-allocation planar RGB uses three logical PlaneByteLayout values with
separate offsets into one retained physical allocation and a sample stride of
one byte.

The empty-region audit verifies that an empty resident extent remains valid
geometry while sample access remains impossible.

The public compile probes additionally verify that callers cannot fabricate a
successful ownership disposition through the module-private
OwnedRasterImportResult constructor.

## C6.7 external retained-import link closure

C6.7 closes a binary-link coverage gap discovered while integrating the R0.3
region/streaming research with the public retained raster import API.

The existing C6.5 public probes compile external consumer modules, but they do
not perform a final link of an independently built DUB consumer. That distinction
matters for retained ownership because RasterLease contains reference-counted
state whose destructor path crosses Phobos template instantiations.

A separate external `dub test` consumer exposed the gap. The public import
itself compiled successfully, ordinary executable consumers linked, and the
then-current root raster-library unittest suite passed. An independently compiled unittest
consumer, however, referenced a required SafeRefCounted/object.destroy
instantiation that the separately built raster-library archive did not provide.

Using compiler-wide all-instantiation flags made the reproducer link, which
confirmed a template-emission/separate-compilation boundary. Such flags are not
part of the raster-d consumer contract and are not used as the fix.

The retained representation is therefore split according to its actual
semantics:

- RasterBacking is an untyped retained storage object containing physical byte
  resources, stable plane descriptors, metadata allocations, and resident
  geometry;
- RasterBackingOwner is one concrete SafeRefCounted!RasterBacking owner;
- creation of that owner occurs through the non-templated
  makeRasterBackingOwner() function inside raster-d;
- RasterLease!T, RasterView!T, construction, validation, and raster operations
  remain sample-type aware.

This gives the separately compiled raster-d library one concrete code-generation
anchor for the retained backing destruction path without changing the public
sample-typed API.

The permanent regression package is:

    tests/external/raster_import_link

It performs a real public ownership transition:

    malloc allocation
        -> OwnedByteResource
        -> tryImportOwnedRaster!ubyte
        -> RasterLease!ubyte
        -> RasterView!ubyte
        -> sample inspection
        -> external RasterLease destruction

The probe is executed with `dub test`, so success requires source compilation,
dependency-library construction, final executable linking, unittest execution,
and destruction of the retained lease.

No `-allinst`/`--allinst` workaround is used.

The probe runs in both the normal CI compiler matrix and the compiler-floor
matrix. It complements rather than replaces the compile-only public-surface and
DIP1000 lifetime probes.
