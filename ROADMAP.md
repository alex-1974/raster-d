# imagery-d Roadmap

## Current implementation checkpoint — 2026-09-19

The repository has progressed beyond the initial architecture-only stage while
the long-term milestone structure below remains valid.

Current core status:

- retained resource ownership and raster backing are implemented;
- `RasterView` provides the read-only semantic resident view;
- signed-stride and multi-plane backing validation are implemented;
- execution layouts and Mir adapters remain internal;
- scalar reduction/copy kernels and measured specializations exist internally;
- `ubyte -> float` conversion has a checked internal dispatch path;
- per-resource `readOnly` / `readWrite` provenance is retained;
- writable backing certification is implemented;
- package-internal `WritableRasterView` with writable ROI, sample read and
  sample write semantics is implemented and DIP1000-tested with DMD and LDC;
- `RasterLease` can derive a package-internal lease-bound writable borrow from
  retained `readWrite` resources, while const leases and escaping borrows are
  rejected by the DIP1000 lifetime model;
- `WritableRasterView` now exposes the minimal package-internal execution
  primitives required by the existing contiguous writable-target consumers:
  shared plane-layout classification and a lifetime-bound mutable region-origin
  execution pointer;
- flat-contiguous planes of a certified `WritableRasterView` can now derive the
  existing package-internal `RasterTargetPlane` capability while preserving
  DIP1000 lifetime provenance through the target and existing Mir adapters;
- the existing checked copy and exact `ubyte -> float` conversion consumers are
  verified end-to-end through retained `RasterLease -> WritableRasterView ->
  RasterTargetPlane` destinations without changing their operation-local
  physical non-overlap checks.

The current raster-operations sequence is:

```

`WritableRasterView` is intentionally still package-internal. It establishes
write permission but does not imply uniqueness, non-aliasing, contiguity or
thread exclusivity.

The resident raster/view core now includes both read-only and writable
lease-bound lifetime integration, the first contiguous writable execution
bridge, and verified integration of that bridge with the existing checked copy
and exact conversion consumers.

The public operation-contract redesign is complete. E5.4f.5c production
mapping remains complete: the accepted alias, affine-layout, exact-overlap, and
checked-wide-arithmetic research is represented by the smallest production
machinery required by the concrete same-type copy and ubyte-to-float conversion
consumers.

The affine relation and checked-wide machinery remains package-internal, and
the wide/Diophantine implementation remains private. No persistent alias-proof
token, general writable-target hierarchy, or public operation API has been
introduced.

The explicit E5.4f closeout review is complete. E5.4g stable public operation
exposure is now the next stage and remains not started until its implementation
work begins.

M2 has partial internal implementation used to validate the engine
architecture; copy, reduction and conversion machinery are not yet exposed as
stable public raster operations.

At this checkpoint, the coordinated repository/worktree rename had not yet been
performed: the repository and DUB package still used the historical `d-imagery`
name. The reorganization on 2026-09-18 subsequently renamed the project and DUB
package to `imagery-d`.

## R0 — Constraints, Research and Architecture

The first phase determines the architecture before the core API is stabilized.

### R0.0 — Operational constraints

Define measurable limits and workload classes for:

- RAM;
- cache memory;
- temporary memory;
- dataset dimensions;
- allocations;
- I/O;
- CPU throughput;
- interactive latency;
- concurrency;
- cancellation;
- numerical correctness;
- portability.

Establish benchmark metrics before optimising implementation.

Deliverable:

    docs/research/execution.md

### R0.5 — CPU and SIMD research

Use deliberately simple kernels:

- copy;
- fill;
- RGB channel extraction;
- RGB to grayscale;
- point transform;
- LUT;
- min/max reduction;
- histogram;
- small convolution.

- provenance;
- hashes.

Deliverable:

    docs/research/test-corpus.md
    benchmark/scenes/
    benchmark/sources/

### R0.8 — Prototype bake-off

Implement disposable competing prototypes.

At minimum compare:

- `mir.ndslice` versus custom views;
- planar versus interleaved layouts;
- fixed tiles versus arbitrary regions;
- generic versus contiguous fast paths;
- whole-image versus streamed execution;
- sequential versus parallel processing.

Production compatibility is not required.

### R0.9 — Architecture synthesis

Consolidate the research into:

- terminology;
- ownership model;
- raster/view representation;
- region/window API;
- dependency/halo model;
- cache model;
- source model;
