    Semantic writable raster view.

    WritableRasterView is deliberately separate from ownership and retained
    resource metadata.

    Construction is permitted only after the represented raster region has
    already been certified writable from retained ResourceAccess provenance.

    The type means:

        writes through this view are permitted

    It does not mean:

        unique
        exclusive
        non-aliasing
        contiguous
        single-plane
        thread-exclusive

    PlaneDescriptor remains access-neutral and continues to store
    const(void)*. Mutable typed access is formed only inside the narrow trusted
    sample-write boundary below.

    The semantic view is public from E5.4g.1 onward.

    Construction/certification and execution-oriented members remain
    package-internal.

    Non-owning writable semantic raster view.

        Attempts to query execution capabilities for one logical writable

        This is an internal control-plane query.

        It derives layout metadata only and does not itself form a mutable
        pointer or grant any additional write capability.

        Classification deliberately reuses the same shared execution-layout
        logic as RasterView.

        Attempts to expose the signed physical strides required by an

        This mirrors RasterView.tryExecutionPlaneStrides().

        The query exposes metadata only:

        - no mutable pointer is formed;
        - no write capability is created;
        - no uniqueness, exclusivity or noalias property is established.

        On failure both output strides are reset to zero.

    /++
        Resolves the mutable physical address of the first logical sample of
        one writable plane in the current region.

        This is the narrow trusted mutable execution-pointer boundary.

        Writable certification has already established that mutation of every
        represented reachable sample is permitted.

        Ordinary backing validation has already established descriptor
        alignment, coordinate representation, stride-product arithmetic,
        combined offsets and physical reachability.

        This function therefore consumes an already-established writable
        capability; it does not create one.

        It establishes no uniqueness, exclusivity, noalias, source/target
        non-overlap or thread-exclusivity property.

        Empty regions return null before any coordinate conversion or pointer
        arithmetic.

        The returned pointer remains lifetime-bound to this writable-view
        borrow.

        Attempts to create a writable child ROI relative to this view.

        Writable certification is inherited because every reachable child
        sample is a subset of the already-certified parent sample set.

        This method deliberately requires a mutable receiver. A
        const-qualified WritableRasterView must not be usable to recover a new
        writable child capability.

        On failure `success` is false and WritableRasterView.init is returned.

        Attempts to read one logical sample.

        Read semantics intentionally reuse RasterView's already-established
        checked semantic accessor rather than duplicating read-side address
        arithmetic.

        Coordinates are relative to this view.

        On failure `value` is reset to T.init.

        The method is `scope` with respect to its implicit `this` borrow.
        Reading may create temporary aliases internally, but none may escape
        the call.

        Attempts to write one logical sample.

        Coordinates are relative to this view.

        Returns false without writing when the band or coordinates are outside
        the represented view.

        This is the narrow trusted mutable sample-access boundary.

        Safety argument:

        - creation of WritableRasterView is restricted to a package boundary
          whose caller has already certified complete writable resource
          coverage;
        - ordinary retained-backing validation already proved descriptor
          alignment, coordinate representation, stride-product arithmetic,
          combined offsets, and physical reachability;
        - a child ROI can only narrow that already-certified sample set;
        - the bounds checks below keep x/y inside the certified Region2D;
        - the cast from access-neutral const(void)* to T* consumes the
          previously established writable capability; it does not create that
          capability.

        The type promises no uniqueness or non-aliasing.

/++
    Constructs a WritableRasterView from metadata whose complete represented
    sample set has already been certified writable.

    This function performs no ResourceAccess or physical-range proof itself.

    Its caller must have established:

    - ordinary RasterView backing invariants;
    - complete write-capable resource coverage for every represented
      non-empty plane;
    - lifetime of descriptor metadata and physical storage.

    Child ROI construction may call this boundary without repeating physical
    certification because the child reachable sample set is a subset of the
    certified parent set.

    `return scope` ties the descriptor borrow in the returned view to the
    supplied stable descriptor block.

/++
    Attempts to create a semantic WritableRasterView from complete physical
    raster metadata.

    This is the package-visible initial writable-capability boundary.

    It deliberately requires:

        retained ResourceEntry[]
        stable PlaneDescriptor[]
        Region2D

    and performs:

        ordinary backing validation
            ->
        writable resource certification
            ->
        private assume-certified construction

    A caller therefore cannot manufacture write capability from
    PlaneDescriptor[] + Region2D alone.

    `validation` always receives the ordinary backing-validation result.

    `certification` remains conservatively unsuccessful when ordinary
    validation fails.

    The returned borrow is lifetime-related to both resource metadata and
    descriptor metadata through the return-scope parameters.

    Success establishes only permission to write represented samples.

    It does not establish uniqueness, noalias, source/target non-overlap,
    execution layout or thread exclusivity.
