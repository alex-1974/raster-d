    Public retained ownership token for one physical byte resource.

    OwnedByteResource deliberately hides the raw ResourceEntry representation.

    Public callers may obtain a token only through an explicit ownership
    adoption API. Source-specific adapters may use package-internal raw
    adoption after establishing their own release/context invariants.

/++
    Move-only ownership token for one retained physical byte resource.

    An armed token owns exactly one release obligation.

    Destroying an armed token releases that resource exactly once.

    Moving the token transfers the obligation. A moved-from or relinquished
    token owns nothing.

        This function is trusted because successful construction of an

/++
    Package-internal raw ownership-token construction.

    On success the caller transfers one complete ResourceEntry release
    obligation.

    `owned` must be empty. If it is already armed, the function returns false
    without modifying either ownership obligation; the supplied ResourceEntry
    remains caller-owned.

    This function can validate structural requirements such as non-null base
    and release function, but it cannot prove releaseContext lifetime, the
    correctness of the external release callback, or the truth of the supplied
    resource access capability.

    `resource.access` is preserved exactly as supplied. Adoption does not infer
    or upgrade read access to write access.

    Consequently the boundary remains @system.

/++
    Adopts one malloc/free-compatible allocation.

    On success ownership of `base` transfers to `owned`.

    `owned` must be empty. Adoption never replaces an existing release
    obligation.

    If `owned` already owns a resource, the function returns false, leaves
    `owned` unchanged, and ownership of `base` remains with the caller.

    The caller must not free or otherwise release `base` after a successful
    call.

    Successful adoption records the physical resource as read-write.

    The caller therefore also asserts that the complete adopted byte range is
    valid writable storage for the lifetime of the ownership obligation.

    A null base is rejected and no ownership transfer occurs.

    This API deliberately uses a `ref` output target rather than `out`.
    Resetting an already-live ownership token to `.init` would bypass its
    release transition.

    The function is @system because the library cannot prove that:

    - base really denotes a free()-compatible allocation;
    - byteLength correctly describes that allocation;
    - the complete adopted byte range is writable;
    - the caller truly owns the allocation being transferred.

    After successful adoption normal OwnedByteResource lifetime management does
    not require raw callback/context handling.
